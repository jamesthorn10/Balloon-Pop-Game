#Balloon Pop Game

The game uses the webcam to detect hand gestures, allowing players to pop virtual balloons by touching them with their
index finger.
Integrated the OpenCV library for real-time video processing and hand tracking.
Utilized Pygame for the user interface and game logic.
Collaborated with MediaPipe’s HandTrackingModule for accurate hand detection and tracking
